# Linux-Device-Driver-for-the-RTC-DS3231-Module
An RTC is an electronic device that keeps track of the current date and time by using an internal battery that allows it to continue running even when the primary source of power is turned off.Since the RpbPi4 doesn't have any a built-in clock,so a real-time clock (RTC) module is needed at driver level.
It suports reading the time from the chip DS3231 in the format hh:mm:ss and also writing the current time to the RTC.
